Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. It's

A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI and more.
Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
Backed by library support, so we don’t have to build everything from scratch, there’s probably a library that already does what we need.
Requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.
Provides Libraries / Frameworks like Django, Flask, Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more for Web Development, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis
Cross-platform, works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.
Used by top tech companies like Google, Netflix and NASA.
Many Python coding job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML

8. Python Packages or Libraries
Python is a huge collection of Python Packages standard libraries that make development easier. These libraries help with a wide range of tasks and can save you a lot of time by providing ready-to-use tools.

Some commonly used types of libraries in Python include:

Packages
Built-in Modules
DSA Libraries
GUI Libraries
9. Data Science with Python
1. Foundational Libraries: These are the libraries that form the base for all data science work. Start here to build a strong foundation.

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
2. Advanced Visualization and Statistical Tools: Once you’re comfortable with basic data handling and visualization, move to creating cleaner visuals and performing statistical analysis.

Seaborn
Statsmodel
3. Machine Learning Libraries: After data manipulation and visualization, learn machine learning, starting with simpler models and moving to advanced ones.
